        <p>At the most basic level, middleware enables developers to build applications without having to create a custom integration every time they need to connect to application components (services or microservices), 
            data sources, computing resources or devices.
            It does this by providing services that enable different applications and services to communicate using common messaging frameworks such as JSON (JavaScript object notation), 
            REST (representational state transfer), XML (extensible markup language), SOAP (simple object access protocol), or web services. 
            Typically, middleware also provides services that enable components written in multiple languages - 
            such as Java, C++, PHP, and Python - to talk with each other.</p>
